# jQuery highlightTextarea

## Overview
highlightTextarea is a jQuery plugin which allows you to highlight words and sentences inside of &lt;textarea&gt; and &lt;input&gt; elements. Words are defined in a jQuery array and you can customize highlight color and case sensitivity. The highlighting updates itself when typing in the &lt;textarea&gt; and follows scroll and resizing (with jQuery-UI).

This version of the plugin has been modified for use with [PlanHub](https://planhub.me). Because of this, it may make assumptions about highlight text color, styling, and other things. If you want a general-purpose version, you can try [the original version](https://github.com/mistic100/jquery-highlighttextarea), but it is currently discontinued and unsupported by its author.
